## Overview
**Video-Gateway** is a high-performance WebRTC signaling server and engagement module designed for the *DevFleetSync* ecosystem. It bridges the gap between real-time video conferencing and your automated infrastructure, providing secure, reputation-gated access to video streams.

## Core Features
*   **Signaling Engine:** Lightweight Go implementation for P2P WebRTC handshakes.
*   **Security:** Integrated with `src/auth` for JWT-based session validation.
*   **Analytics:** Automated JSON session logging for repository reporting.
*   **Infrastructure:** Fully containerized via `deployma` for seamless integration.

## Reputation & Access
This module utilizes your **Deployma** credentials. Access is restricted based on reputational credit:
*   **Required Credit Score:** >500
*   **Authentication:** Must provide valid bearer token through the websocket header.
